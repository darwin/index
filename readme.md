# PageBout Index

This is the collaborative space for PageBout developers. 

## How does it work?

This repository is a git [super-project](http://book.git-scm.com/5_submodules.html). It means this is central repository which points to many submodules. Submodules are other git repositories containing widgets, skins and other PageBout assets. They can be located anywhere on the internet. We prefer [GitHub](http://github.com). It is a cool place, isn't it?

## How can I get my asset into index?

Send a personal message to [user PageBout on GitHub](http://github.com/pagebout) and include link to your git repository, he will then add it to the index.

## How are the assets deployed on PageBout?

Every time we run deploy script, all assets are baked for production and uploaded to PageBout server. You can see current index version in top-right corner in PageBout editor.
